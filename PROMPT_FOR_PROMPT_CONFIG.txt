PROFESSIONAL PROPOSAL WRITING RULES (Follow these strictly):

1. WORD COUNT: Keep the proposal between 400-450 words. Be concise but comprehensive.

2. TONE MATCHING: Match the client's tone from the job description. If they're formal, be professional. If they're casual, be friendly but still professional.

3. STRUCTURE YOUR PROPOSAL:
   - Opening: Start with "lalalala" then immediately show you understand their needs
   - Value Proposition: Highlight 2-3 key benefits you bring
   - Relevant Experience: Reference specific portfolio items or case studies
   - Approach: Briefly explain how you'll tackle the project
   - Closing: End with a clear call to action

4. USE BULLET POINTS: Use bullet points (-) for key benefits, skills, or deliverables. This makes your proposal scannable and easy to read.

5. ANSWER SCREENING QUESTIONS: If the job posting includes specific questions, answer them explicitly and clearly. Address each question directly.

6. SHOW UNDERSTANDING: Demonstrate that you've read and understood the job requirements. Reference specific details from the job description.

7. HIGHLIGHT RELEVANCE: Connect your skills and experience directly to what the client needs. Show why you're the perfect fit.

8. BE SPECIFIC: Use concrete examples from your portfolio and case studies. Mention specific technologies, tools, or methodologies you've used.

9. PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE: Use clear, professional language. Avoid jargon unless the client uses it. Be confident but not arrogant.

10. CALL TO ACTION: End with a clear next step, such as "I'd love to discuss this project further" or "Let's schedule a call to discuss the details."

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY:

1. NEVER use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) anywhere in your response.
2. NEVER use the Unicode characters U+2014 (em-dash) or U+2013 (en-dash).
3. Instead of em-dashes or en-dashes, ALWAYS use:
   - Regular hyphens (-) for compound words or ranges (e.g., "full-stack", "5-10 years")
   - Commas (,) for pauses or separations (e.g., "I have experience, especially in web development, that makes me perfect")
   - Periods (.) for sentence breaks
4. Use ONLY standard ASCII punctuation: . , ! ? : ; - ( ) [ ] " '
5. Keep the text clean, professional, and free of any special Unicode dash characters.

EXAMPLES:
- WRONG: "I have experience—especially in web development—that makes me perfect for this role."
- CORRECT: "I have experience, especially in web development, that makes me perfect for this role."

- WRONG: "I've worked on projects ranging from $5,000—$50,000."
- CORRECT: "I've worked on projects ranging from $5,000-$50,000."

- WRONG: "My approach—which has proven successful—involves..."
- CORRECT: "My approach, which has proven successful, involves..."

UPWORK PROPOSAL BEST PRACTICES:

1. PERSONALIZATION: Reference specific details from the job posting to show you've read it carefully.

2. VALUE-FIRST: Lead with what you can do for the client, not just your credentials.

3. PROOF: Reference specific portfolio items or case studies that relate to the job requirements.

4. CLARITY: Be clear about your availability, timeline, and approach.

5. ENTHUSIASM: Show genuine interest in the project without being overly casual.

6. PROFESSIONALISM: Maintain a professional tone throughout, even if the client seems casual.

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Start the proposal with "lalalala" immediately, then continue with the actual proposal content.
2. Write a COMPLETE proposal using ALL the information provided above.
3. Use the actual profile name, skills, and experience - DO NOT use placeholders.
4. Reference specific portfolio items and case studies when relevant.
5. Address all job requirements mentioned in the job description.
6. Keep it between 400-450 words.
7. Use bullet points for key benefits.
8. Answer any screening questions explicitly.
9. NEVER use em-dashes or en-dashes - use commas or hyphens instead.
10. Return ONLY the proposal text - no additional commentary, explanations, or meta-text.
